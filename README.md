#  SkillSwap  
**Smart Peer Skill-Exchange Platform | MERN Stack**

SkillSwap helps people **teach what they know** and **learn what they need**  
by matching them with the most compatible learning partners.

> Learn faster by teaching. Grow faster by connecting.

---

##  Why SkillSwap?
Most learning platforms are **one-directional** → teacher → student.  
SkillSwap is **mutual** → **You teach + You learn**.

We built:
- A **smart matching engine**  
- A **connection workflow**  
- **Contact sharing** only after match acceptance  

…making it a **real** matching product, not just another CRUD system.
